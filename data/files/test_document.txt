Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing how we interact with technology.
Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data.

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process information.
These networks can recognize patterns in images, text, and other data types.

Applications
- Computer Vision: Image recognition and object detection
- Natural Language Processing: Text analysis and generation
- Robotics: Autonomous systems and decision-making

Conclusion
AI and ML continue to advance rapidly, with new applications emerging daily.
